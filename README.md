# VDrop

![Screenshot of index page](screenshot.png)

VDrop is a project created for the Hacker Zephyr, a hackathon run by Hack Club that took place on a cross country train in the summer of 2021. We had very limited access to the internet so code here is likely messy/unpolished and not reflective of what I'd make for a longer term project. VDrop allows users to record a single 1-second video every day. The next day, all of the videos are combined into a single "drop" which is released on the site. VDrop is built using Next.js/React/TypeScript. As part of this, I built my own UI library using `makeStyles` as well as an advanced [`styled`](/tree/main/src/ui/theme.tsx) function to make it really easy to build components. I may eventually extract this out into its own repository, but for now it is only in this repo.
